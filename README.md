# A Space Game

## This game is going to have 3 phases:
First phase is managing to get your rocket into space.

Second phase is trying to get to Mars while avoiding space litter and asteroids.

Third phase is getting all objects photographed with your Mars rover.

## The Game:

The controller is going to have 2 stickers, one of which is only going up and down (left one) and the other one to the right and left (right one).
In addition, it will have 2 buttons, which will be used differently depending on the game phase.
In the first phase, one button will start the rocket engine to start flying up.
And the other button will drop fuel tanks that have ended.
The player has to very slowly push the sticker up so that the rocket slowly starts flying.
If the player doesn't push the sticker or push the sticker suddenly, the rocket will blow up.
When the fuel tanks empty, the player will be notified to drop them out and start the main engine by pressing right button again.
The player will get to phase 2 when he reaches certain height.

In phase 2, the player will be managing to get to Mars while avoiding space litter at the beginning and then asteroids.
Left sticker will make player's ship/capsule go forwards or backwards and right sticker will turn his ship/capsule.
Right button will make his ship/capsule boost either forwards or backwards depending which direction the player hold left sticker.
Left button, however, will make player's ship/capsule suddenly move to the right or left, again, depending on which direction player is holding the right sticker.
Phase 3 is started whenever the player reaches Mars.

In Phase 3, the player, first of all, has to land his ship.
Here will be no unique mechanics, only left sticker is used to control his speed.
However, when the player lands his ship/capsule, he will then control a Mars rover.
His task is to photograph all objects marked on the screen.
Standard controls: left sticker - forwards or backwards, right sticker - turns the Mars rover.
Right button will make a photograph, whereas left button will make the Mars rover's "head" go up.
At this point, the player can't move and the stickers will turn his head accordingly.
This is made for objects that will be on the ground, as the Mars rover can't look straight down.
Pressing left button again will get the Mars rover back to normal.
Getting all objects photographed ends the game.

## Strech Goals
* Might also think of an interesting ending.
* Adding vibration to the controller when the rocket starts flying.

## Differentiation of the controller
* Two big stickers with a button on top of it (like in the helicopter).
* Think of a different control for buttons - maybe sensitive things (like touchpad?).
* The stickers could also be attached to a chair's handles.
