You control the character by the book by charging your spells while holding your hand on the left page and using your magic by touching two of the circles (not 3). This was made to give some engagement to the player.

It is cool, because you can feel yourself as a wizard by gradiosely holding this book and casting spells by moving your finger around those circles.

Players have to melt the ice, which also holds candies. But the city is close to that ice and players can either melt it and endanger the city and try to save it from the flood. Also, the city was built with paper and sugarcubes, which is kind of original.

This type of game is interesting as it makes you think unusual way to melt the ice, so that you could save the city and also have the candies that are stuck in the ice.

Draw anything, and animal, dragon, human, whatever you wish and turn it to life. After finishing your masterpiece, stamp it with a heart and it starts walking.

THIS IS SO COOL. Whatever you draw can become life. This is like a child’s dream.
